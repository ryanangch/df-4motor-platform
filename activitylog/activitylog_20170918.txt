- [ryanangch] Purchased roll of wire, soldering tools, larger breadboard, capacitors (10nF,100 nF,470nF)
- [chc] Demo EM interference
- Tested connecting 10nF capacitors parallel to motor connection with H-bridge, less signal distortion on same side, distortion still observed on opposite side
- Suggested coding to extract encoder (and any future implementation) data to .csv for ease of documentation
- [WIP] Purchase Lithium-polymer battery packs
- [NEXT] Rework entire electronic assembly


2017.09.16 Saturday

- [chc] Decided to purchase Lithium-polymer battery packs instead of using 5xAA batteries
- [chc] Detected electromagnetic interference by motor brushes to encoder wire (encoder signals distorted), decided to try connecting capacitors or using twisted pairs or aluminium foils


2017.09.14 Thursday

- Configured openCV with Microsoft Visual Studio


2017.09.09 Saturday

- Purchased 4 jumper wire bundles (of 3) F/M to connect H-bridge to Arduino Uno
- [ryanangch] Purchased wire stripper, velcro, cloth (to insulate metal platform from electronic assembly)
- 



2017.09.08 Friday

- First hardware assembly (mobile platform, motors, H-bridges, Arduino Uno, breadboard)
- Left and right motors share direction signals, pulse width modulation (PWM) signals individual for each motor
- PWM did not work until value exceeds 127, reason being using Arduino Uno pins that are unable to output PWM
- Switched pins to 3,9,10,11 for PWM
- Lacking F/M jumper wires, complete wire connections available for only 3 motors
- Shakedown of all motors, each one individually, FR, RR, RL collectively
