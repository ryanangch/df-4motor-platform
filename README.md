 - RF and electrical interference from DC motor is causing erratic behavior in the input to pin 3.
 - presence of RF inteference has been verified by chc via a simple test (varying the distance between the dc motor and the wire leading into pin 3). 
 - need to find some way to shield the EM inteference (aluminium foil, twisted pair, etc.)
 - need to buy capacitors to reduce electrical noise
